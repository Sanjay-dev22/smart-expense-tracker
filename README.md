🚀 Smart Expense Tracker — Feature Expansion Roadmap
Each phase builds on the last, gradually taking your project from basic → professional-grade 💼

✅ Phase 1: Visual & Functional Boost
📅 Week 1: UI/UX + Analytics

Upgrade UI with Tailwind CSS / Material UI

Mobile-first layout

Cleaner forms, cards, table

Add Charts (Dashboard)

Use recharts or chart.js

Pie Chart: Expenses by Category

Line Chart: Daily/Monthly Expense Trend

Add Filters

Filter by category

Filter by date range (e.g., last 7 days)

✅ Outcome: A professional-looking UI with dynamic data visualization

🔐 Phase 2: User Login + Data Isolation
📅 Week 2: Auth + Multi-user system

Add Firebase Google Authentication

One-click Google Sign-In

Store token in frontend (React context)

Add JWT-Based Backend Auth

Backend verifies token → returns user info

Restrict APIs to logged-in users only

Store Expenses by User

Every expense tied to userId from Firebase

Each user sees only their own data

✅ Outcome: Secure multi-user system with login

📅 Phase 3: Budget Control & Tracking
📅 Week 3: Budgets + Alerts

Add Monthly Budget Feature

User sets a monthly budget (₹ amount)

Show a progress bar of current spend vs budget

Add Budget Exceeded Alerts

Warn user when they’re near or past the limit

Optional email reminder

✅ Outcome: Turns the app into a budgeting tool — more than just tracking

📥 Phase 4: Export & Uploads
📅 Week 4: Advanced utilities

Export to CSV

Button to download current month’s expenses

Libraries: json2csv, xlsx

Upload Receipts (Cloudinary or Firebase Storage)

Attach image/PDF to each expense

Preview receipts in modal or new tab

✅ Outcome: Professional features for financial users

🔁 Phase 5: Recurring & Reminders
📅 Week 5: Automation and daily usability

Mark Recurring Expenses

Auto-add rent, subscriptions, etc. each month

In-App Notifications

E.g., “You spent ₹5000 this week”

Optionally: Add email.js for alerts via email

✅ Outcome: Smart, semi-automated tracking

🔧 Phase 6: Polish & Deploy Like a Pro
📅 Week 6: Docs, shareability, optimization

Improve GitHub README with GIFs/screenshots

Add "About this App" section in your UI

Deploy new version with subdomain (e.g., expenses.sanjay.live)

Mobile PWA Mode (optional)

Add to home screen, offline usage

✅ Outcome: Resume-worthy SaaS-style application 🚀

🔑 BONUS IDEAS (For future or hackathons)
Currency conversion

Speech-to-expense (voice entry)

Family shared group expenses (multi-user budget)
